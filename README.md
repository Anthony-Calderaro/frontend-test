# Upright Labs Frontend Test

You'll need to develop a web UI that is capable of recording the mouse of a user. The app needs to record the mouse positions, persist it to a local database, then be able to replay the mouse positions on the screen.

Here's a video demo https://www.useloom.com/share/bf207dc338c146899b4c0d40b1dec1e5.

### Steps

- Send to jackson@uprightlabs.com

### Spec

- Should have a UI where a user can record their mouse, play back recordings, view all previous recordings, delete previous recordings
- Recordings should be at 60fps
- Every recording should have a name
- Once a recording has been taken, it should persist to a database. I should be able to go view all previous recordings and play any of them.

### How we grade this test

- Does it work as expected?
- Does it have a functional UI? Does the UI look good?
- Is this performant? Does this work at 60fps?
- Do they use best practices in their code? Up to date dependencies/ dev tools?
- Does it actually save recordings to a db?
- Is code readable? Well documented? Are design decisions documented?
- Does the UI have a nice design?
- Are there instructions for how to run the app?
- Are there tests?
